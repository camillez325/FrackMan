## Description
In FrackOff, you're the Frackman who's trying to pass all levels by digging out all oil barrels hidden under the mining field. 

In the process, there are protesters of different types that come to the field once in a while to stop the Frackman from his mission. They can come up and yell at Frackman untill Frackman gets annoyed enough to drop the level. Frackman can also attack those protesters by shooting his water gun to harm them, and using his goodies, such as the golden nuggets he digs out from the mining field, to bribe the protesters to leave him alone. 

Within the field, there are also boulders that stay stationary untill someone dig out the dirt underneath them. Boulders can harm both Frackmand and protesters to an equal degree, which is immediate drop of 100% health. Once in a while, there will also be goodies such as water pool (so that Frackman can refill his water gun), and sonar kits (so that Frackman can use to illuminate hidden objects around him) that appear at random places on the field. But they are not permanent goodies. They only stay on the field for a certain period of time before Frackman picks them up.

The levels progress in several ways. The number of oil barrels required to be discovered increase, the period of time in which temporary goodies stay on the field decrease. The number of protesters that the field can accomodate at a time increase. The speed in which protesters move increase. Also, a speicial type of protester, which is shown with a light blue, and a slighly bigger icon in graphic, is able to signal Frackman's cellphone further away, and chases him more quickly.
